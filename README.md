# DEMO
https://simghb91.github.io/Vintage_TV_style/

# Features
- This project faithfully reproduces the power-on and screen effect of an old CRT television.
- The page can be used as an introductory screen for presenting a personal portfolio.
- It uses of [Typewriter](https://safi.me.uk/typewriterjs/), a simple yet powerful native javascript plugin for a cool typewriter effect.
- If any point on the page is clicked with the left mouse button, the background sound effect of the TV will start. You can stop the sound with a second click.
- Fully responsive on smartphones, tablets and laptops

# Any idea or new feature?
Currently this theme isn't in dev mode. I wanted to keep it very simple and minimal but other cool features could be added. Feel free to propose what you think could be done better.
